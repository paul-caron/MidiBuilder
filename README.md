# MidiBuilder
build music midi files

- First you compile the source code (g++ / clang++)
- Then you run the executable and you will see prompts
- Once you know what the prompts are for, you can start piping data from individual files (see testsong/song.sh)
- Then make awesome music. Quickly and easily.
